## Lecture hall

All sessions take place in [38.04](https://campus.uni-stuttgart.de/cusonline/pl/ui/$ctx;lang=DE/ris.ris?pOrgNr=599&pQuellGeogrBTypNr=5&pZielGeogrBTypNr=5&pZielGeogrBerNr=6050009&pRaumNr=7051&pActionFlag=A&pShowEinzelraum=J), Universitätsstr. 38, ground floor.
We plan to do the complete course **on site**. As the course is heavy on interactive labs, a hybrid mode seems not very suitable. Please contact us if you can only join online nonetheless. If needed, we will find a solution.

## Time

Lectures and lab work are both on Thursdays:

* 09:45–11:15
* 15:45–17:15

There is not strict distinction between both slots. It depends on the topic and the week. Normally, we do a more lecture-style session in the morning and a more lab-style session in the afternoon.

## Time table

Please note that we might adjust the time table during the semester. You find a more detailed version on [GitHub](https://github.com/Simulation-Software-Engineering/Lecture-Material/blob/main/timetable.md).
