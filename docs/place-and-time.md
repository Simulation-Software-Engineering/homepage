## Lecture hall

All sessions take place in [38 - 0.124](https://campus.uni-stuttgart.de/cusonline/pl/ui/$ctx;lang=DE/ris.ris?pOrgNr=14&pQuellGeogrBTypNr=5&pZielGeogrBTypNr=5&pZielGeogrBerNr=6050009&pRaumNr=7038&pActionFlag=A&pShowEinzelraum=J), Universitätsstr. 38, ground floor.
We plan to do the complete course **on site**. As the course is heavy on interactive labs, a hybrid mode seems not very suitable. Please contact us if you can only join online nonetheless. If needed, we will find a solution.

## Time

Lectures and lab work are both on Thursdays:

* 09:45–11:15
* 15:45–17:15

There is not strict distinction between both slots. It depends on the topic and the week. Normally, we do a more lecture-style session in the morning and a more lab-style session in the afternoon.

## Time table

We will add a detailed time table at the beginnging of the lecture period. As a reference, you can already have a look at the one from [winter term 2021/22 on GitHub](https://github.com/Simulation-Software-Engineering/Lecture-Material/blob/main/timetable.md).
