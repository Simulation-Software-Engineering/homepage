## About


Software is an integral part of nowadays research. A [UK survey in 2014](https://zenodo.org/record/1183562#.YTHZ91uxUUE) found that 7 out of 10 researchers could not conduct research without software. However, research software engineering (RSE) does not yet get the necessary attention in research and in teaching. All this applies to simulation software in particular.

## Content of the course

The course is about simulation software. More precisely, we discuss the software tools used to ensure good software engineering for open-source simulation software such as FEniCS, PETSc, TRILINOS, DuMuX, preCICE, or SU2. This is not a course focused on programming and programming paradigms, but on the techniques and the correspnding tools. Some examples are version control (Git, GitHub, GitLab), virtualization/containerization (Docker), continuous integration (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI), or documentation  (Jekyll, mkdocs, sphinx).

## Target audience

This course is aimed at master-level students from Computer Science, Simulation Technology and related fields, but is also open to PhD students or anyone else interested. We expect you to have some knowledge in software development, basic tools and programming. However, we also give you extra information or point to additional resources if you have the feeling you need to catch up with some topic.

*An example*: In the lecture, we shortly touch on [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

- You are a Git expert? This is great. We try not to bore you.
- You have used Git before, but you basically use the same 5 commands all the time? This is fine and a good foundation to start.
- You had heard about Git some time in a lecture, but you have never used it? You are good to go with the examples in the lectures and the references presented there, but you probably have to catch up a bit.

## Resources

All teaching resources are (will be) available online on GitHub and on this homepage.

We encourage **you** to help us extend these resources and fix mistakes.

## Assignments and lab work.

There are two types of assignments. We have smaller weekly lab work, which helps you to get familiar with the presented software engineering concepts and tools.


Parallel to the lab work, you work on an individual challenge, where you apply the learned concepts and tools with the ultimate goal to contribute to a large-scale community simulation software package. The challenge is structured in three parts, whereas each part is completed by a short presentation of the intermediate results in class:

1. You get acquainted with the basic functionality of a large-scale simulation software package (such as FEniCS, PETSc, TRILINOS, DuMuX, preCICE, or SU2) by studying tutorials and documentation (first quarter of the course)
2. You analyze the RSE infrastructure and the development cycle of the software package (second quarter of the course). 
3. You contribute to the software package. The contribution can be small, but should not be trivial. Possible examples: Adding a new tutorial, extending the documentation, working on a "good first issue", adding support of a new package manager. Important is to properly go through all development steps if possible (contact community, open issue, open pull request, test, review, merge).


The lab work and assignments are an important part of the course. There will be **no** written or oral exam at the end of the lecture. Instead, you are evaluated continuously based on the lab work and assignments.

## Additional information for SimTech students

You might also be interested in the course *Sustainable Development of Simulation Software* by Bernd Flemisch and Dennis Gläser, which is starting in summer term 2022. Their course has a stronger focus on software engineering patterns and project work in C++ for simulation software. Our course *Simulation Software Engineering* focuses more on the tools commonly used in the development of simulation software. The course of Flemisch/Gläser is **not** a prerequisite to follow our course on simulation software engineering and neither vice versa. We encourage you, however, to follow both courses if you are interested in the topic.
