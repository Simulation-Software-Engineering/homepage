Some quotes from previous evaluations:

- *I wished I had such a lecture already during my Bachelor's program.*
- *I like that we've seen so many different topics that are relevant for each project you work on.*
- *High practical relevance also beyond simulation science.*
- *I especially liked the fact that the lectures are always connected with real examples, such as the connections with the open-source project preCICE.*
